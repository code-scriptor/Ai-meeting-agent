# My First GitHub Project: Meetinger ðŸŽ‰

Hey there! This is my first ever GitHub repository. I created this project as part of a hackathon â€” it was an intense but super fun experience where I learned a lot in a short time!

## ðŸ“Œ About

This repo contains the code I wrote during the hackathon. It might be rough around the edges, but it represents a big step in my journey as a developer. I'm sharing it to document the experience, show what I built, and (hopefully) get feedback or ideas for improvement.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Built under time pressure during a hackathon ðŸ•’
- Simple and focused on solving a specific problem
- Uses :- Sends Meeting recaps to members
        - Adds tasks and events on members' google calendar
- First time working with Ai agents.(had a lot of fun on n8n)
I will try to continue on this project so you expect some updates
## ðŸ’¡ Why I made this

The project was built for a hackathon challenge by HackwithIndia and K.A.M.A.L.A. community. I wanted to apply my skills in a real-world, fast-paced scenario, and this was the perfect opportunity to do that. Itâ€™s my first step toward building more collaborative, open-source projects â€” and hopefully, many more will follow!
